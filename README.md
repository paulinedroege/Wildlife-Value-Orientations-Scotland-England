# Wildlife-Value-Orientations-Scotland-England
Abstract:
Social conflicts over wildlife often reflect and can be intensified by people’s values regarding wildlife. These values have been classified into four Wildlife Value Orientations (WVOs) – traditionalist, mutualist, distanced, and pluralist – derived from individuals’ attitudes toward human-wildlife interactions. While WVOs help explain differences in perceptions of wildlife management, variation in WVOs across cultures remains uncertain, and no study has yet examined WVOs in the United Kingdom. We analyzed survey data from 807 respondents living in Scotland and England, capturing WVOs and socio-demographic factors. We found no statistically significant differences in the proportions of each WVO between the two countries. However, WVOs were associated with respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics – men and highly religious respondents leaned traditionalist, and higher earners leaned pluralist. Understanding WVOs cross-culturally, and their associations with specific groups, can inform more effective conservation strategies to manage conflicts over wildlife.
